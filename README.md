# Eve Whom?

This is a small project I created along side my friend Clayton. I came up with the idea when more and more frequently I would login to the game EvE Online after long breaks and have people recognise me and I would have no idea who they were.

To solve this issue I have created CorpMates, Simply type your name into the top box and either paste an individual or the entirety of the system into the second and hit submit. This will then take between a few seconds and a minute to process. Once complete a list of anyone you share mutual history with will be shown below.
